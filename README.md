## Description

When creating an application as a developer, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README. It should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. In an effort to give developers a practical tool that saves them time away from coding, I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file using the [Inquirer.js npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

## Installation

Step 1: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
Step 2: Clone this repository to your local drive.
Step 3: Open Git Bask (PC) or Terminal (Mac) and navigate to the root directory of this cloned repository.
Step 4: Enter `npm i inquirer` in the command line to install the `Inquirer.js` npm package dependency as detailed in the package.json.
Step 5: Enter `node index.js` in the command line to invoke the application.

## Usage

This application uses the `Inquirer.js` npm package to prompt the user with a series of questions that will help create a personalized, professional README. The prompts gather information such as project description, installation instructions, license specifications, support information, and more.

After the prompts have been answered by the user, the application automatically generates a markdown file that is saved to the root directory of the user's project. The README also includes a license badge located at the top of the markdown in order to add legitimacy to the project.

For an example of the README that this application generates, please open "Demo-README.md" located in this repository.

## Contributing
